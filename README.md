For this homework assignment I first changed the <title></title> to Horiseon to reflect the "company" name
Next I focused on replacing <div> elements that had assigned classes with semantic tags to seperate the header, section, sidebar, and footer.
Then I moved into the css and removed any classes that were no longer in use and instead referenced the element within the semantic tag to adjust the styling.
I moved the <aside> semantic tag to be above the <section> semantic tag as that is good practice.
Lastly I assigned alt attribues to all images an icon to describe the image to the best of my abilites.
